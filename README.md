Moving jobs added by wordpress Job Manager to another server
============================================================

For example.com
Old website has Job Manager plugin installed and have multiple number jobs added with its categories.
For new website installed Job Manager plugin and copied job posts from OLD site manually.
Atfter adding few of jobs, new site is made live for example.com (with incomplete job posts)
Few days later again started adding job posts to example.com,for quick changes jobs data is moved from one wordpress database to another. 
Here job posts are moved from wordpress database along with its post meta information and categories.
Tested with localhost database and finally executed with live servers database it is working fine.
